# Core Java OOP 🚀

This project demonstrates the core concepts of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** in **Java**, with simple and practical examples.  
It serves as part of my learning journey to strengthen Java fundamentals before building larger projects.

---

## 🧠 Concepts Covered

- **Classes and Objects** – Defining blueprints and creating instances  
- **Inheritance** – Reusing and extending parent class properties  
- **Method Overriding** – Achieving runtime polymorphism  
- **Polymorphism** – Dynamic method dispatch examples  
- **Encapsulation** – Data hiding and access through getters/setters  
- **Abstraction (coming soon)** – Will include abstract classes and interfaces in future updates

## 🧩 Example Classes

| File | Description |
|------|--------------|
| `Main.java` | Entry point demonstrating various OOP examples |
| `Animal.java` | Base class with generic animal behavior |
| `Dog.java` | Subclass extending `Animal` with overridden methods |
| `Cat.java` | Another subclass showing polymorphism |
| `Bird.java` | New class added to demonstrate additional behavior and inheritance |
